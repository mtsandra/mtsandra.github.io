I"¢<p>This series is inspired by my recent efforts to learn about applying deep learning in the music information retrieval field. I attended a two-week <a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/workshops/deep-learning-for-music-information-retrieval-I">workshop</a> on the same topic at Stanfordâ€™s Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics, which I highly recommend to anyone who is interested in AI + Music. This series is guided by Choi et al.â€™s 2018 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04396">paper</a>, <em>A Tutorial on Deep Learning for Music Information Retrieval</em>. Iâ€™d like to give a shoutout to Chris Olahâ€™s wonderful explanation on LSTM as well.</p>
