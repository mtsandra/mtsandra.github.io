I"·<p>I‚Äôve always wanted a neat little personal website to consolidate my writings and personal projects (both artistic and technical) in one place. Ideally, it would be minimalistic and not too complicated to maintain. I‚Äôm also cheap, so I don‚Äôt want to pay for website hosting. All these factors made Github Pages the perfect site for me ‚Äì free with a little bit of work.</p>

<p>Turns out I‚Äôm a little bit particular when it comes to the website aesthetics. My first choice is <a href="https://github.com/xukimseven/HardCandy-Jekyll">HardCandy</a> because of Marceline from Adventure Time (I love BMO!) used in the demo. But the template is a little outdated and I couldn‚Äôt get it to work. Then I came across the <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">al-folio</a> template, which is what my current website is built off of.</p>

<p>I have limited experience with Jekyll before, so I did this weirdly satisfying step by step <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/">tutorial</a> on the Jekyll official website to help me understand how Jekyll sites work. I found the below command really helpful, it allows your work-in-progress website hosted on the local server to reload automatically as you are making updates. Note that updates made to the _config.yml do not refresh until you restart your server. But for other updates, it refreshes automatically.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>jekyll serve --livereload
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once it worked fine on my local environment, I decided to deploy it to my github.io server to make sure this template works before I‚Äôd spend way too much time invested in it. Morphe‚Äôs Law kicked in again, GitHub was throwing me an error in the build workflow :sweat_smile:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>github-pages 227 | Error: Liquid syntax error (line 5): Unknown tag 'twitter'
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>I tried a couple of solutions on al-folio‚Äôs GitHub repository (shoutout to them for keeping it active and alive), but none of them worked. I even tried the manual deployment option listed in their Readme file. Frustrated, I forced myself to take a magic walk break. I love walk breaks, the problems I‚Äôm stuck on are usually resolved magically after my walk break. Anyways, it‚Äôs because the deploy file has the source branch as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code>, but GitHub‚Äôs default branch has been renamed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code>. I changed all the ‚Äúmaster‚Äù in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./bin/deploy</code> to ‚Äúmain‚Äù.</p>

<p>I also want to point out that it is essential to make sure that your GitHub Pages is deployed from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> and not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code>. You can change this in the Settings page of your github.io repository.</p>

<p>After both things are done, I pushed the updated code to my github.io repository, and it worked!! :heart_eyes: Now I have a working personal website!‚Äô</p>
