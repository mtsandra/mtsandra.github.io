I"5<p>Hello! Nice to meet you :) My name is Aleksandra, or Sandra for short.</p>

<p>I am currently a Music Technology Master’s student at Georgia Tech doing research at the intersection of applied machine learning and music. Right before this, I was a consultant at Deloitte where I built and managed a data analytics engine for a global subscription streaming service client. I also spent some time in the Bay Area getting my Bachelors degree in Statistics and Data Science at UC Berkeley.</p>

<p>I often contemplate on what it means to be human, so most of what I do outside of work is centered around it. I enjoy exploring new technology that enhances the human experience. I love music :notes: (I know, who doesn’t?) I was classically trained in piano and have been teaching myself how to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/aleksandra-ma-20897898">mix music</a>. I take <a href="/projects/alice-alice-photography/">pictures</a> of people, from my friends to strangers.</p>

<p>I have a tuxedo kitty named <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lil_poncho119/">Poncho</a>.</p>
