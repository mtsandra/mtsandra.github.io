I"ù<p>Hello! Nice to meet you :) My name is Aleksandra, or Leksa for short.</p>

<p>I graduated from UC Berkeley Statistics &amp; Data Science in 2020. Now I‚Äôm a consultant at Deloitte, where I build and manage a data analytics engine for a global subscription streaming service client with my awesome teammates.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm applying for grad school this year, and I‚Äôm hoping to focus on AI + audio. I‚Äôm especially interested in Music Information Retrieval. You can find some of my relevant projects and writings under the tab <a href="/projects">projects</a> and <a href="/blog">blog</a>.</p>

<p>I often contemplate on what it means to be human, so most of what I do outside of work is centered around it. I enjoy exploring new technology that enhances the human experience. I love music :notes: (I know, who doesn‚Äôt?) I was classically trained in piano and have been teaching myself how to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/aleksandra-ma-20897898">mix music</a>. I take <a href="/projects/alice-alice-photography/">pictures</a> of people, from my friends to strangers.</p>

<p>I have a tuxedo kitty named <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lil_poncho119/">Poncho</a>.</p>
