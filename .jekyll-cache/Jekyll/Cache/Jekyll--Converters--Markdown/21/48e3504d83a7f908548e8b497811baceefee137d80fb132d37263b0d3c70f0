I"è<p>Over the weekend I watched the quick course put out by Andrew Ng and Isa Fulford about ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for developers. In the video series, they showed a lot of examples that inspired me to come up with my own application ideas, so I definitely recommend watching the course. It took me around 2 hours to finish the whole series. Below are notes for quick reference and reminders.</p>
