I"à<p>Iâ€™ve always wanted a neat little personal website to consolidate my writings and personal projects (both artistic and technical) in one place. Ideally, it would be minimalistic and not too complicated to maintain. Iâ€™m also cheap, so I donâ€™t want to pay for website hosting. All these factors made Github Pages the perfect site for me â€“ free with a little bit of work.</p>

<p>Turns out Iâ€™m a little bit particular when it comes to the website aesthetics. My first choice is <a href="https://github.com/xukimseven/HardCandy-Jekyll">HardCandy</a> because of Marceline from Adventure Time (I love BMO!) used in the demo. But the template is a little outdated and I couldnâ€™t get it to work. Then I came across the <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">al-folio</a> template, which is what my current website is built off of.</p>

<p>I have limited experience with Jekyll before, so I did this weirdly satisfying step by step <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/">tutorial</a> on the Jekyll official website to help me understand how Jekyll sites work. I found the below command really helpful, it allows your work-in-progress website hosted on the local server to reload automatically as you are making updates. Note that updates made to the _config.yml do not refresh until you restart your server. But for other updates, it refreshes automatically.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>github-pages 227 | Error: Liquid syntax error (line 5): Unknown tag 'twitter'
</code></pre></div></div>
