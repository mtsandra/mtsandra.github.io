I"Â<p>Iâ€™ve always wanted a neat little personal website to consolidate my writings and personal projects (both artistic and technical) in one place. Ideally, it would be minimalistic and not too complicated to maintain. Iâ€™m also cheap, so I donâ€™t want to pay for website hosting. All these factors made Github Pages the perfect site for me â€“ free with a little bit of work.</p>

<p>Turns out Iâ€™m a little bit particular when it comes to the website aesthetics. My first choice is <a href="https://github.com/xukimseven/HardCandy-Jekyll">HardCandy</a> because of Marceline from Adventure Time (I love BMO!) used in the demo. But the template is a little outdated and I couldnâ€™t get it to work.</p>
