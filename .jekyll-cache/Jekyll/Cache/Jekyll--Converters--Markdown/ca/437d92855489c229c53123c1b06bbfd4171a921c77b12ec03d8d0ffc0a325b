I"<p>I’ve always wanted a neat little personal website to consolidate my writings and personal projects (both artistic and technical) in one place. Ideally, it would be minimalistic and not too complicated to maintain. I’m also cheap, so I don’t want to pay for website hosting. All these factors made Github Pages the perfect site for me – free with a little bit of work.</p>
