    <p>Digital Signal Theory <a href="https://brianmcfee.net/dstbook-site/content/intro.html">book</a> by Brian McFee 
  This book is such a chefâ€™s kiss for anyone who does not have a signal processing background and looking to gain a rich understanding of audio signal processing. The book has started from the most fundamental concepts like what it means for a signal to be periodic and extended into more sophisticated concepts like Fourier Transform. Prof. Brian McFee has also done a great deal of quality research in music information retrieval and is an active member of the MIR community.</p>
