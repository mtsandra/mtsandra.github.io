I"õ	<p>Iâ€™ve always wanted a neat little personal website to consolidate my writings and personal projects (both artistic and technical) in one place. Ideally, it would be minimalistic and not too complicated to maintain. Iâ€™m also cheap, so I donâ€™t want to pay for website hosting. All these factors made Github Pages the perfect site for me â€“ free with a little bit of work.</p>

<p>Turns out Iâ€™m a little bit particular when it comes to the website aesthetics. My first choice is <a href="https://github.com/xukimseven/HardCandy-Jekyll">HardCandy</a> because of Marceline from Adventure Time (I love BMO!) used in the demo. But the template is a little outdated and I couldnâ€™t get it to work. Then I came across the <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">al-folio</a> template, which is what my current website is built off of.</p>

<p>I have limited experience with Jekyll before, so I did this weirdly satisfying step by step <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/">tutorial</a> on the Jekyll official website to help me understand how Jekyll sites work. I found the below command really helpful, it allows your work-in-progress website hosted on the local server to reload automatically as you are making updates. Note that updates made to the _config.yml do not refresh until you restart your server. But for other updates, it refreshes automatically.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>jekyll serve --livereload
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once it worked fine on my local environment, I decided to deploy it to my github.io server to make sure this template works before Iâ€™d spend way too much time invested in it. Morpheâ€™s Law kicked in again, GitHub was throwing me an error in the build workflow :sweat_smile:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>github-pages 227 | Error: Liquid syntax error (line 5): Unknown tag 'twitter'
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>I tried a couple of solutions on al-folioâ€™s GitHub repository (shoutout to them for keeping it active and alive), but none of them worked. I even tried the manual deployment option listed in their Readme file. Frustrated, I forced myself to take a magic walk break. I love walk breaks, the problems Iâ€™m stuck on are usually resolved magically after my walk break. Anyways, itâ€™s because the deploy file has the source master as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code></p>
