I"1<p>One of the most famous philosophical questions posed by Albert Camus is whether one should commit suicide, a question whose answer can solve the most fundamental philosophical problems such as the meaning of life. In this French Nobel Literature Prize winner’s eyes, the world is absurd, consisting of a series of random events. Thus, human’s existence in this chaos is also meaningless. The stance he took on the dynamics between the world and human beings comes into play fairly strongly in his novel <em>The Stranger</em>. By following the life of Meursault, the main character in <em>The Stranger</em>, we will take a closer look at how he delicately uses the power of language and narrative to portray the absurdity of the world and proposes his philosophy of human’s revolt against such absurdity.</p>
