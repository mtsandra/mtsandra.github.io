## Resources
#### Signal Processing
- Digital Signal Theory [book](https://brianmcfee.net/dstbook-site/content/intro.html) by Brian McFee 
    This book is such a chef's kiss for anyone who does not have a signal processing background and looking to gain a rich understanding of audio signal processing. The book has started from the most fundamental concepts like what it means for a signal to be periodic and extended into more sophisticated concepts like Fourier Transform. Prof. Brian McFee has also done a great deal of quality research in music information retrieval and is an active member of the MIR community.

- Audio Signal Processing for Music Applications [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/audio-signal-processing) by Xavier Serra and Julius Smith
