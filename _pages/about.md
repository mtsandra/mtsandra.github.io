Hello! Nice to meet you :) My name is Aleksandra, or Sandra for short. 

I am a music AI researcher and master's student in the Music Technology program at Georgia Tech, advised by Prof. Alexander Lerch. My research focuses on integrating human subjectivity and creativity into intelligent music systems. I am interested in developing music algorithms that are customized and localized, as well as building systems capable of co-creating with musicians. 

Since this past summer, I’ve been working on musician-AI co-design research at MIT with Prof. Anna Huang, and I’ve also been interning at Bose for some time on real-time audio-visual speech enhancement. Before that, I worked as an analytics consultant at Deloitte and completed my bachelor’s degree in Data Science and Statistics in the Bay Area.

I often contemplate on what it means to be human, so most of what I do outside of work is centered around it. I enjoy exploring new technology that enhances the human experience. I love music :notes: (I know, who doesn't?) I have been a singer and played the piano all my life, and I sometimes take [pictures](/projects/alice-alice-photography/) of people, from my friends to strangers.

I have a tuxedo kitty named [Poncho](https://www.instagram.com/lil_poncho119/).
