Hello! Nice to meet you  :) My name is Aleksandra, or Sandra for short. 

I graduated from UC Berkeley Statistics & Data Science in 2020 :bear:  Now I'm a consultant at Deloitte, where I build and manage a data analytics engine for a global suscription streaming service client with my awesome teammates.

I often contemplate on what it means to be human, so most of what I do outside of work is centered around it. I enjoy exploring new technology that enhances the human experience. I love music :notes: (I know, who doesn't?) I was classically trained in piano and have been teaching myself how to [mix music](https://soundcloud.com/aleksandra-ma-20897898). I take [pictures](/projects) of people, from my friends to strangers. I [write](/blog) occasionally too.

I have a tuxedo kitty named [Poncho](https://www.instagram.com/lil_poncho119/).
