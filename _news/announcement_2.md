From August 2020 to January 2021, I was working on the Open Policy Analysis project for deworming interventions at UC Berkeley Center for Effective Global Actions [(CEGA)](https://cega.berkeley.edu/) with [Fernando Hoces de la Guardia](https://www.bitss.org/people/fernando-hoces-de-la-guardia/). I am a firm believer of transparency and open science, so I was really excited to work on this project :heart_eyes: The OPA project aims to help policymakers understand the social and fiscal effects of deworming in underdeveloped countries. 

I was co-leading the visualization efforts and supporting the project writing efforts. See the full project link [here](http://www.bitss.org/opa/projects/deworming/). It includes the Github repository to reproduce the whole project, the Shiny app with interactive plots to try out different assumptions of the deworming research papers, and a dynamic document detailing the approach.
